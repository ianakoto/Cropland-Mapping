## Introduction
Welcome to the Global Cropland Mapping Project! This initiative aims to develop advanced methods for mapping cropland extent worldwide with high accuracy. Timely and precise cropland maps are essential for agriculture, environmental research, and sustainability efforts.

## Project Description
Timely and accurate crop maps are crucial for various applications in agriculture, natural resources, environment, health, and sustainability. Existing global cropland maps have limitations, such as infrequent updates, differing definitions of "cropland," and significant discrepancies.

This project addresses these challenges by leveraging state-of-the-art remote sensing data and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to provide an open-source, high-resolution cropland mapping solution for a better understanding of global agricultural landscapes.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. **Developing methods for annually cropland extent mapping at 10m resolution:** We aim to create accurate and cost-effective classification models capable of mapping cropland extent at a spatial resolution of 10 meters, providing more detailed and precise information about cropland distribution.

2. **Testing the temporal extendibility of the proposed method at a local scale:** To ensure robustness and scalability, we will assess the performance of our models over time. This includes evaluating the ability of the models to provide consistent and reliable cropland extent maps when applied to different temporal datasets, especially at a local scale.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below.
